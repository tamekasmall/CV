## SKILLS

#### Communicate + Teach

Having the ability to explain and communicate ideas has been intrinsic to my way of working, with subject matters ranging from secondary school physics and maths or even providing the succinct instructions serving as dialogue for my yoga classes. It has also given me a greater appreciation to the art of listening, a skills which serves as powerful feedback for assessing the effectiveness of explanations and also fully comprehending key objectives.


#### Learning + Research

Journeying through code and growing as a software developer at Makers Academy has required me to continuously absorb information and learn new things daily.  I enjoy the challenge and the process of learning and I feel that I’m aware enough to identify areas in my knowledge and on it.
